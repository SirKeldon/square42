This is another exercise to code one of the most classy solo games, in this case a particular one cause it plays by itself and it was created more to be a mathematical exercise, Game Of Life. Never used RxJS nor stateless, so this game was the perfect candidate to do it.

Still pending to add controls in order to be able to control the grid.
